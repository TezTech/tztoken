# tztoken
tzToken is a token standard developed by TezTech Labs, which runs on the Tezos blockchain. Our standard is modular, and implements a hex-based interface (which is built using the fi smart contract language). This allows us to develop easy interfaces and guides for simple integration with various apps, wallets and exchanges.

For information about the tztoken standard, please visit our website. You can also check out our JS utility library (which works with eztz.js) for interfacing with the tztoken, as well as our Technical Integration Guide.
